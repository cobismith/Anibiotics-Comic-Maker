## About the Comic Maker ##

This drag and drop comic maker was created by the State Library of Queensland (SLQ) for [Fun Palaces](http://funpalaces.co.uk/). It's been adapted for WHO Antibiotics Awareness Week in Vanuatu. This is a work in progress, you can test the beta here: https://cobismith.github.io/antibiotics-comic-maker/src/index.html

It's from a concept by [Matt Finch](https://matthewfinch.me/about/) who devised a physical [comic book dice game](https://matthewfinch.me/2014/10/14/comic-book-dice-a-sequential-storytelling-game/) at the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design in Manila, Philippines. Matt is the 2016 Creative in Residence at SLQ. The game was designed by Phil Gullberg and Talia Yat of [The Edge at SLQ](http://edgeqld.org.au/).

Comic Book Dice was inspired by Jessica Abel and Matt Madden's comic-making activity [Panel Lottery](http://dw-wp.com/2010/05/panel-lottery-an-exercise-in-narrative-juxtaposition-and-editing/), which in turn has roots in the work of Scott McCloud. Comic book games have their own art history!
